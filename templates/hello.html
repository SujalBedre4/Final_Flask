        <h4 class="text-center">Intro</h4>
        An astronaut is a highly trained and equipped individual who serves as a commander or crew member on a
        spacecraft, participating in human spaceflight programs. The term "astronaut" originates from the Greek words
        "astron nautes," meaning "star sailor." Astronauts are responsible for conducting space missions, performing
        extravehicular activities (EVAs), and contributing to scientific research in space. To prepare for the physical
        and mental demands of space travel, astronauts undergo rigorous training, which includes a comprehensive program
        of physical conditioning, scientific and technical education, and simulation-based training
        <br>
        <br>
        To become an astronaut, one must possess a strong foundation in scientific and technical knowledge, excellent
        physical and mental health, and a passion for the mission. Astronauts undergo rigorous training, which includes
        extensive medical exams, physical conditioning, simulation-based training, and continuous learning to prepare
        for the challenges of space travel.
